	ABSTRACT = {Image registration is a common operation in any type of image processing, specially in remote sensing images. Since the publication of the scale–invariant feature transform (SIFT) method, several algorithms based on feature detection have been proposed. In particular, KAZE builds the scale space using a nonlinear diffusion filter instead of Gaussian filters. Nonlinear diffusion filtering allows applying a controlled blur while the important structures of the image are preserved. Hyperspectral images contain a large amount of spatial and spectral information that can be used to perform a more accurate registration. This article presents HSI–KAZE, a method to register hyperspectral remote sensing images based on KAZE but considering the spectral information. The proposed method combines the information of a set of preselected bands, and it adapts the keypoint descriptor and the matching stage to take into account the spectral information. The method is adequate to register images in extreme situations in which the scale between them is very different. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm has been tested on real images taken on different dates, and presenting different types of changes. The experimental results show that the method is robust achieving image registrations with scales of up to     24 . 0 ×    .},

	abstract = {Reducing pesticide use is one of the high-priority targets in the quest for a sustainable agriculture. Until now, most studies dealing with pesticide use reduction have compared a limited number of experimental prototypes. Here we assessed the sustainability of 48 arable cropping systems from two major agricultural regions of France, including conventional, integrated and organic systems, with a wide range of pesticide use intensities and management (crop rotation, soil tillage, cultivars, fertilization, etc.). We assessed cropping system sustainability using a set of economic, environmental and social indicators. We failed to detect any positive correlation between pesticide use intensity and both productivity (when organic farms were excluded) and profitability. In addition, there was no relationship between pesticide use and workload. We found that crop rotation diversity was higher in cropping systems with low pesticide use, which would support the important role of crop rotation diversity in integrated and organic strategies. In comparison to conventional systems, integrated strategies showed a decrease in the use of both pesticides and nitrogen fertilizers, they consumed less energy and were frequently more energy efficient. Integrated systems therefore appeared as the best compromise in sustainability trade-offs. Our results could be used to re-design current cropping systems, by promoting diversified crop rotations and the combination of a wide range of available techniques contributing to pest management.},

However the current methods are limited when large and highly non-local deformations are present. In this paper, we introduce a new direct feature matching technique for non-parametric image registration where efficient nearest-neighbor searches find global correspondences between intensity, spatial and geometric information. We exploit graph spectral representations that are invariant to isometry under complex deformations. Our direct feature matching technique is used within the established Demons framework for diffeomorphic image registration. Our method, called Spectral Demons, can capture very large, complex and highly non-local deformations between images. We evaluate the improvements of our method on 2D and 3D images and demonstrate substantial improvement over the conventional Demons algorithm for large deformations.",

	ABSTRACT = {The Minimum Linear Arrangement problem (MinLA) consists in finding an ordering of the nodes of a weighted graph, such that the sum of the weighted edge lengths is minimized. We report on the usefulness of a new model within a branch-and-cut-and-price algorithm for solving MinLA problems to optimality. The key idea is to introduce binary variables d_{ijk}, that are equal to 1 if nodes i and j have distance k in the permutation. We present formulations for complete and for sparse graphs and explain the realization of a branch-and-cut-and-price algorithm. Furthermore, its different settings are discussed and evaluated. To the study of the theoretical aspects concerning the MinLA, we contribute a characterization of a relaxation of the corresponding polyeder. },

	abstract = {Crop agronomic parameters (leaf area index (LAI), nitrogen (N) uptake, total chlorophyll (Chl) content ) are very important for the prediction of crop growth. The objective of this experiment was to investigate whether the wheat LAI, N uptake, and total Chl content could be accurately predicted using spectral indices collected at different stages of wheat growth. Firstly, the product of the optimized soil-adjusted vegetation index and wheat biomass dry weight (OSAVI×BDW) were used to estimate LAI, N uptake, and total Chl content; secondly, BDW was replaced by spectral indices to establish new spectral indices (OSAVI×OSAVI, OSAVI×SIPI, OSAVI×CIred edge, OSAVI×CIgreen mode and OSAVI×EVI2); finally, we used the new spectral indices for estimating LAI, N uptake, and total Chl content. The results showed that the new spectral indices could be used to accurately estimate LAI, N uptake, and total Chl content. The highest R2 and the lowest RMSEs were 0.711 and 0.78 (OSAVI×EVI2), 0.785 and 3.98 g/m2 (OSAVI×CIred edge) and 0.846 and 0.65 g/m2 (OSAVI×CIred edge) for LAI, nitrogen uptake and total Chl content, respectively. The new spectral indices performed better than the OSAVI alone, and the problems of a lack of sensitivity at earlier growth stages and saturation at later growth stages, which are typically associated with the OSAVI, were improved. The overall results indicated that this new spectral indices provided the best approximation for the estimation of agronomic indices for all growth stages of wheat.},

This review focuses on technological aspects of integrating unmanned aerial vehicles with imaging systems to enhance field phenotyping capabilities. The state-of-the-art of unmanned aerial vehicle technology for various applications including crop emergence, vigor, and characterization of yield potential of row and field crops has been reviewed. The potential of using aerial imaging to evaluate resistance/susceptibility to biotic and abiotic stress for crop breeding and precision production management has been discussed along with future perspectives and developments."
