In this article, we review the risk of climate-related impacts along the land-based livestock food supply chain. Although a quantification of the net impacts of climate change on the livestock sector is beyond the reach of our current understanding, there is strong evidence that there will be impacts throughout the supply chain, from farm production to processing operations, storage, transport, retailing and human consumption. The risks of climate-related impacts are highly context-specific but expected to be higher in environments that are already hot and have limited socio-economic and institutional resources for adaptation. Large uncertainties remain as to climate futures and the exposure and responses of the interlinked human and natural systems to climatic changes over time. Consequently, adaptation choices will need to account for a wide range of possible futures, including those with low probability but large consequences.}

    ABSTRACT = {Timely and reliable information about crop management, production, and yield is considered of great utility by stakeholders (e.g., national and international authorities, farmers, commercial units, etc.) to ensure food safety and security. By 2050, according to Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimates, around 70% more production of agricultural products will be needed to fulfil the demands of the world population. Likewise, to meet the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), especially the second goal of “zero hunger”, potential technologies like remote sensing (RS) need to be efficiently integrated into agriculture. The application of RS is indispensable today for a highly productive and sustainable agriculture. Therefore, the present study draws a general overview of RS technology with a special focus on the principal platforms of this technology, i.e., satellites and remotely piloted aircrafts (RPAs), and the sensors used, in relation to the 5th industrial revolution. Nevertheless, since 1957, RS technology has found applications, through the use of satellite imagery, in agriculture, which was later enriched by the incorporation of remotely piloted aircrafts (RPAs), which is further pushing the boundaries of proficiency through the upgrading of sensors capable of higher spectral, spatial, and temporal resolutions. More prominently, wireless sensor technologies (WST) have streamlined real time information acquisition and programming for respective measures. Improved algorithms and sensors can, not only add significant value to crop data acquisition, but can also devise simulations on yield, harvesting and irrigation periods, metrological data, etc., by making use of cloud computing. The RS technology generates huge sets of data that necessitate the incorporation of artificial intelligence (AI) and big data to extract useful products, thereby augmenting the adeptness and efficiency of agriculture to ensure its sustainability. These technologies have made the orientation of current research towards the estimation of plant physiological traits rather than the structural parameters possible. Futuristic approaches for benefiting from these cutting-edge technologies are discussed in this study. This study can be helpful for researchers, academics, and young students aspiring to play a role in the achievement of sustainable agriculture.},

Smart and precision farming allows farmers to be more informed and productive. The advent of 5G will considerably change the nature of jobs in farming and agriculture. The internet of things (IoT)-based cloud computing service in the 5G network provides flexible and efficient solutions for smart farming. This will allow the automated operation of various unmanned agricultural machines for the plowing, planting, and management phases of crop farming and will ultimately achieve secure, reliable, environmentally friendly, and energy-efficient operations and enable unmanned farms. This paper provides a complete survey on 5G technology in the agricultural sector and discusses the need for and role of smart and precision farming; benefits of 5G; applications of 5G in precision farming such as real-time monitoring, virtual consultation and predictive maintenance, data analytics and cloud repositories; and future prospects.}

    abstract = {Chlordecone is an organochlorine insecticide used until 1993 in the banana plantations of the French Antilles. Recent surveys revealed its wide presence in the environment. This current paper focuses on the impact of different management options on the Martinican population’s food exposure, taking into account that an appreciable part of the food consumed in Martinique corresponds to subsistence production. Food exposure is assessed through deterministic models. Consumption data derive from the ESCAL Survey on 1814 subjects aged 3 and over. Residues data come from the Monitoring Programs 2002–2004. Different scenarios are studied depending on whether the subjects live on a soil-contaminated place or not and on their supply habits. The impact of various maximum limits is then analysed. The probability of exceeding the chronic health-based guidance value (CHGV) of 0.5μg/kgbw/day is, respectively, 20.9% (CI95th [6.2; 34.4]) and 15.6% (CI95th [9.6; 20.8]) for children and adults living in a soil-contaminated area and null for the remaining population. MLs below 300μg/kgfw would reduce significantly the exposure but the probability of exceeding the CHGV remains statistically different from zero when only commercialised products are taken into account. This study shows the supply habits may have significant impacts on food exposure to contaminants. It reveals that setting MLs, which can only be controlled on commercialised products, is not enough in such situations. Other management options like consumption recommendations for self-produced foodstuffs are necessary to protect the Martinican consumer.}

Thus, after decades of studies and regulation efforts, it remains unknown whether to what degree and at what concentrations modern agricultural pesticides cause regional-scale species losses. We analyzed the effects of pesticides on the regional taxa richness of stream invertebrates in Europe (Germany and France) and Australia (southern Victoria). Pesticides caused statistically significant effects on both the species and family richness in both regions, with losses in taxa up to 42\% of the recorded taxonomic pools. Furthermore, the effects in Europe were detected at concentrations that current legislation considers environmentally protective. Thus, the current ecological risk assessment of pesticides falls short of protecting biodiversity, and new approaches linking ecology and ecotoxicology are needed. }

    abstract = {Agricultural activities such as tillage, drainage, intercropping, rotation, grazing and extensive usage of pesticides and fertilizers have significant implications for wild species of flora and fauna. Species capable of adapting to the agricultural landscape may be limited directly by the disturbance regimes of grazing, planting and harvesting, and indirectly by the abundance of plant and insect foods available. Some management techniques, such as drainage, create such fundamental habitat changes that there are significant shifts in species composition. This paper considers the relative merits of conventional tillage versus reduced, or no-till farming, and reviews the benefits of rest-rotation grazing, crop rotation and intercropping in terms of maintaining wild species populations. There are a number of undesirable environmental impacts associated with fertilizer and pesticide usage, and in this paper we attempt to provide an account of the ways in which these inputs impact on biodiversity at various levels including plant, invertebrate, and vertebrate groups. Factors which are considered include the mobility, trophic interactions, persistence, and spectrum of toxicity for various pesticides. The ecological virtues of organic and inorganic fertilizers are compared, and the problems arising from excessive use of fertilizer are discussed. The findings in this review indicate that chemical fertilizer loadings must be better budgeted to not exceed local needs, and that pesticide inputs should be reduced to a minimum. The types and regimes of disturbance due to mechanical operations associated with agricultural activity may also be modified to help reduce negative impacts on particular groups of species, such as birds. For those plant and insect species which need to be controlled for agronomic reasons, the population decreases brought about by disturbance regimes may be desirable as a form of pest management. The prevalence of agriculture over such a large portion of the Canadian landscape means that it is important that we find solutions to conflicts that arise between agriculture and wild species. It is important to realize that the impact of agricultural inputs varies greatly among regions and species, and actual effects have generally not been investigated for many species in any one locality; while the focus of this review is on Canada, much Canadian-specific research is lacking, thus, this review also draws from relevant research done elsewhere.}

    abstract = {During the last 50 years, agricultural intensification has caused many wild plant and animal species to go extinct regionally or nationally and has profoundly changed the functioning of agro-ecosystems. Agricultural intensification has many components, such as loss of landscape elements, enlarged farm and field sizes and larger inputs of fertilizer and pesticides. However, very little is known about the relative contribution of these variables to the large-scale negative effects on biodiversity. In this study, we disentangled the impacts of various components of agricultural intensification on species diversity of wild plants, carabids and ground-nesting farmland birds and on the biological control of aphids. In a Europe-wide study in eight West and East European countries, we found important negative effects of agricultural intensification on wild plant, carabid and bird species diversity and on the potential for biological pest control, as estimated from the number of aphids taken by predators. Of the 13 components of intensification we measured, use of insecticides and fungicides had consistent negative effects on biodiversity. Insecticides also reduced the biological control potential. Organic farming and other agri-environment schemes aiming to mitigate the negative effects of intensive farming on biodiversity did increase the diversity of wild plant and carabid species, but – contrary to our expectations – not the diversity of breeding birds. We conclude that despite decades of European policy to ban harmful pesticides, the negative effects of pesticides on wild plant and animal species persist, at the same time reducing the opportunities for biological pest control. If biodiversity is to be restored in Europe and opportunities are to be created for crop production utilizing biodiversity-based ecosystem services such as biological pest control, there must be a Europe-wide shift towards farming with minimal use of pesticides over large areas.
    Zusammenfassung
    Durch die Intensivierung der Landwirtschaft in den letzten 50 Jahren sind viele Pflanzen- und Tierarten auf regionaler und nationaler Ebene ausgestorben und ist die Funktion des Agrarökosystems beeinträchtigt. Die landwirtschaftliche Intensivierung umfasst viele verschiedene Faktoren, wie zum Beispiel die Homogenisierung der Landschaft, die Vergrößerung von landwirtschaftlichen Betrieben und Äckern und den zunehmenden Gebrauch von Düngern und Pestiziden. Über den relativen Beitrag der einzelnen Faktoren zu den weitgehenden Auswirkungen der Intensivierung auf die Biodiversität ist jedoch wenig bekannt. In dieser Studie haben wir den Einfluss dieser verschiedenen Faktoren auf die Diversität von Pflanzen, Laufkäfern und bodenbrütenden Ackervögeln sowie auf die biologische Schädlingsbekämpfung von Blattläusen, entwirrt. In einer europaweiten Studie, in acht West- und Ost-Europäischen Ländern, haben wir weitgehende, negative Effekte der landwirtschaftlichen Intensivierung auf Pflanzen, Laufkäfer, bodenbrütende Ackervögel und die biologische Schädlingsbekämpfung - die Anzahl durch natürliche Feinde gefressener Blattläuse - gefunden. Von den dreizehn Faktoren der landwirtschaftlichen Intensivierung die wir gemessen haben, hatte der Gebrauch von Insektiziden und Fungiziden konsequent negative Effekte auf die Biodiversität. Insektizide reduzierten ebenfalls die biologische Schädlingsbekämpfung. Organische Bewirtschaftung und andere Formen von Ökologischem Ausgleich, die zum Ziel haben, die negativen Effekte der Intensivierung auf Biodiversität abzuschwächen, erhöhten die Pflanzen- und Laufkäferdiversität, jedoch – entgegen unseren Erwartungen - nicht die Diversität der Brutvögel. Wir stellen fest, dass trotz jahrzehntelanger europäischer Politik gegen schädliche Pestizide, die negativen Auswirkungen von Pestiziden auf Pflanzen- und Tierarten andauern und damit auch die Möglichkeit biologischer Schädlingsbekämpfung abnimmt. Wenn die Biodiversität in Europa erhalten werden soll und die Chance auf biodiversitätsgebundenen Ökosystemfunktionen, wie biologische Schädlingsbekämpfung, beruhenden Ackerbau geschaffen werden soll, ist eine europaweite Veränderung zu einer Bewirtschaftung mit minimalem Gebrauch von Pestiziden über eine große Fläche notwendig.}

Yet, the scientific evidence informing how these technologies may impact or enhance ecosystem services has not been comprehensively reviewed. In this scoping review, we examine how digital agricultural technologies may enhance agriculture’s support of ecosystem services. Keyword searches in academic databases resulted in 2337 records, of which 74 records met review criteria and were coded. We identify three clusters of digital agricultural technologies including those that make farm management more precise, increase connectivity, and create novel foods. We then examine modelling and empirical evidence gaps in research linking these technologies to ecosystem services. Finally, we overview barriers to implementing digital agricultural technologies for better ecosystem services management in the Canadian context including economic and political systems; lack of policies on data management, governance, and cybersecurity; and limited training and human resources that prevents producers from fully utilizing these technologies. }

    abstract = {The ecosystem services (ES) concept has emerged and spread widely recently, to enhance the importance of preserving ecosystems through global change in order to maintain their benefits for human well-being. Numerous studies consider various dimensions of the interactions between ecosystems and land use via ES, but integrated research addressing the complete feedback loop between biodiversity, ES and land use has remained mostly theoretical. Few studies consider feedbacks from ecosystems to land use systems through ES, exploring how ES are taken into account in land management decisions. To fill this gap, we carried out a role-playing game to explore how ES cognition mediates feedbacks from environmental change on farmers' behaviors in a mountain grassland system. On a close to real landscape game board, farmers were faced with changes in ES under climatic and socio-economic scenarios and prompted to plan for the future and to take land management decisions as they deemed necessary. The outcomes of role-playing game were complemented with additional agronomic and ecological data from interviews and fieldwork. The effects of changes in ES on decision were mainly direct, i.e. not affecting knowledge and values, when they constituted situations with which farmers were accustomed. For example, a reduction of forage quantity following droughts led farmers to shift from mowing to grazing. Sometimes, ES cognitions were affected by ES changes or by external factors, leading to an indirect feedback. This happened when fertilization was stopped after farmers learned that it was inefficient in a drought context. Farmers' behaviors did not always reflect their attitudes towards ES because other factors including topographic constraints, social value of farming or farmer individual and household characteristics also influenced land-management decisions. Those results demonstrated the interest to take into account the complete feedback loop between ES and land management decisions to favor more sustainable ES management.},

    abstract = {This short communication highlights potential destabilisation of the muddy coast of Guyana, South America, caused by large-scale mangrove destruction. The stability of the coast of Guyana, which is part of one of the world's most extensive mangrove coasts, depends on large mud banks migrating alongshore from the mouth of the Amazon River and on mangrove colonisation of these banks. Under the pressures of economic development, the coastal zone of Guyana is progressively being transformed into agricultural land and aquaculture estates, protected by coastal dikes. These hard coastal defence structures, constructed in recent years, are less effective in dissipating wave energy than mud banks. They also hinder the various processes involved in the consolidation and subsequent mangrove colonisation of these banks, notably by enclosing mature mangrove forests and preventing propagule transport from these forests to mud banks. If unchecked, the progressive breakdown in the mud-bank and associated mangrove system that has led to progradation of the coastal plain of Guyana over the last 5000 years will result in large-scale coastal erosion that can only be countered by further engineering structures at prohibitive costs. The only coastal defence strategy, sound and viable over the long term, with regards to both environmental conservation and cost, consists in restoring a dynamic mud-bank and mangrove system on this wave-exposed coast.}

The aim of the present study is to identify morphological changes of the Karoon River in Iran using high accuracy maps and Landsat satellite images by analyses during the time period 1989–2008. In this study, 20 meandering reaches were analyzed over a 128-km-long river reach located in the middle part of the Karoon River, Iran. Morphometric indicators such as: river width (W), meander neck length (L), axis length (A), radius of curvature (R), water flow length (S), and sinuosity of meander (C) were extracted for the identified meanders. The results of a paired t-test showed that river width (W) and meander neck length (L) have significantly changed during the study period (1989–2008), with an increase of +3.5m for W and a decrease of 274m for L. Spearman correlation analysis has shown that meander parameter changes are highly correlated to each other. The parameters that do not have significant correlation together are C with W and L, W and L, and L with S and A. During the period of the study, the flow length and river sinuosity decreased for the whole river reach, by 4.77km and 0.11, respectively. Analysis of land use/land cover categories (1989 and 2008) using the support vector machine (SVM) and kernel function method served as one of the tools for interpretation of the meander parameter changes. These changes can be attributed not only to LU/LC (riparian vegetation to agriculture area ratio) but also to dam construction in the upstream part of the river that leads to major hydrological regime and sediment transfer alteration. Sediment extraction may also be an important factor.}

    abstract = {La quatrième de couverture indique : "Depuis les débuts de l'ère industrielle, l'agriculture s'est engagée dans un processus de destruction de la biodiversité : plus de 90 % des variétés utilisées traditionnellement par les paysans, à l'échelle de la planète, ont déjà disparu de nos champs et de nos assiettes. Pendant que les vestiges de cette diversité étaient stockés dans des banques de gènes réfrigérées à l'usage de l'industrie semencière, les variétés traditionnelles, jugées insuffisamment uniformes, étaient rendues illégales, laissant ainsi la place aux variétés modernes, seules autorisées à la vente et désormais protégées par des droits de propriété intellectuelle. Les poursuites judiciaires lancées contre l'association Kokopelli, qui conserve et distribue une vaste collection de variétés traditionnelles, ont illustré ces sombres développements. À l'heure où se profile une réforme de la législation européenne sur le commerce des semences, ce livre fait la lumière sur un arsenal législatif complexe et nous appelle à une prise de conscience. Car derrière les semences, premier maillon de la chaîne alimentaire, les enjeux sont nombreux : survie du monde paysan, espoir d'une agriculture durable, qualité de l'alimentation, mais aussi survivance d'un patrimoine commun, rempart contre l'appropriation de tout le vivant."},

Whether crop yield{\textendash}related ecosystem services can be maintained by a few dominant species or rely on high richness remains unclear. Using a global database from 89 studies (with 1475 locations), we partition the relative importance of species richness, abundance, and dominance for pollination; biological pest control; and final yields in the context of ongoing land-use change. Pollinator and enemy richness directly supported ecosystem services in addition to and independent of abundance and dominance. Up to 50\% of the negative effects of landscape simplification on ecosystem services was due to richness losses of service-providing organisms, with negative consequences for crop yields. Maintaining the biodiversity of ecosystem service providers is therefore vital to sustain the flow of key agroecosystem benefits to society.},

    abstract = "The implication of neonicotinoids in bee declines led in 2013 to an EU moratorium on three neonicotinoids in bee-attractive crops. However, neonicotinoids are frequently detected in wild flowers or untreated crops suggesting that neonicotinoids applied to cereals can spread into the environment and harm bees. Therefore, we quantified neonicotinoid residues in nectar from winter-sown oilseed rape in western France collected within the five years under the EU moratorium. We detected all three restricted neonicotinoids. Imidacloprid was detected in all years with no clear declining trend but a strong inter- and intra-annual variation and maximum concentrations exceeding reported concentrations in treated crops. No relation to non-organic winter-sown cereals was identified even though these were the only crops treated with imidacloprid, but residue levels depended on soil type and increased with rainfall. Simulating acute and chronic mortality suggests a considerable risk for nectar foraging bees. We conclude that persistent imidacloprid soil residues diffuse on a large scale in the environment and substantially contaminate a major mass-flowering crop. Despite the limitations of case-studies and risk simulations, our findings provide additional support to the recent extension of the moratorium to a permanent ban in all outdoor crops."

    ABSTRACT = {Intelligence has been considered as the major challenge in promoting economic potential and production efficiency of precision agriculture. In order to apply advanced deep-learning technology to complete various agricultural tasks in online and offline ways, a large number of crop vision datasets with domain-specific annotation are urgently needed. To encourage further progress in challenging realistic agricultural conditions, we present the CropDeep species classification and detection dataset, consisting of 31,147 images with over 49,000 annotated instances from 31 different classes. In contrast to existing vision datasets, images were collected with different cameras and equipment in greenhouses, captured in a wide variety of situations. It features visually similar species and periodic changes with more representative annotations, which have supported a stronger benchmark for deep-learning-based classification and detection. To further verify the application prospect, we provide extensive baseline experiments using state-of-the-art deep-learning classification and detection models. Results show that current deep-learning-based methods achieve well performance in classification accuracy over 99%. While current deep-learning methods achieve only 92% detection accuracy, illustrating the difficulty of the dataset and improvement room of state-of-the-art deep-learning models when applied to crops production and management. Specifically, we suggest that the YOLOv3 network has good potential application in agricultural detection tasks.},

    abstract = {For metrology under optical microscopes, lens distortion is the dominant source of error. Previous distortion models and correction methods mostly rely on the assumption that parametric distortion models require a priori knowledge of the microscopes’ lens systems. However, because of the numerous optical elements in a microscope, distortions can be hardly represented by a simple parametric model. In this paper, a generic distortion model considering both symmetric and asymmetric distortions is developed. Such a model is obtained by using radial basis functions (RBFs) to interpolate the radius and distortion values of symmetric distortions (image coordinates and distortion rays for asymmetric distortions). An accurate and easy to implement distortion correction method is presented. With the proposed approach, quantitative measurement with better accuracy can be achieved, such as in Digital Image Correlation for deformation measurement when used with an optical microscope. The proposed technique is verified by both synthetic and real data experiments.}

    abstract = {In order to improve weeding strategies in terms of pesticide reduction, spatial distribution and characterization of in-field weed populations are important. With recent improvements in image processing, many studies have focused on weed detection by vision techniques. However, weed identification still remains difficult because of outdoor scenic complexity and morphological variability of plants. A new method of weed leaf segmentation based on the use of deformable templates is proposed. This approach has the advantage of applying a priori knowledge to the object searched, improving the robustness of the segmentation stage. The principle consists of fitting a parametric model to the leaf outlines in the image, by minimizing an energy term related to internal constraints of the model and salient features of the image, such as the colour of the plant. This method showed promising results for one weed species, green foxtail (Setaria viridis). In particular, it was possible to characterize partially occluded leaves. This constitutes a first step towards a recognition system, based on leaf characteristics and their relative spatial position.}

At present, regional and large-scale fPV, fNPV and fBS estimations have been carried out in many areas. However, few studies have used moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) data to perform large-scale, long-term fPV, fNPV and fBS estimations in the Xilingol grassland of China. The objective of this study was to quantitatively estimate the time series of fPV, fNPV and fBS in the typical grassland region of Xilingol from MODIS image data. Field measurement spectral and coverage data from May and September 2017 were combined with the 8-day composite product (MOD09A1) acquired during 2017. We established an empirical linear model of different non-photosynthetic vegetation indices (NPVIs) and fNPV based on the sample scale. The linear correlation between the dead fuel index (DFI) and fNPV was best (R2 = 0.60, RMSE = 0.15). A normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI)-DFI model based on MODIS data was proposed to accurately estimate the fPV, fNPV and fBS (estimation accuracies of 44%, 71%, and 74%, respectively) in the typical grasslands of Xilingol in China. The fPV, fNPV and fBS values for the typical grassland time series estimated by the NDVI-DFI model were consistent with the phenological characteristics of the grassland vegetation. The results show that the application of the NDVI-DFI model to the Xilingol grassland is reasonable and appropriate, and it is of great significance to the monitoring of soil wind erosion and fires in grasslands.}

    ABSTRACT = {The estimation of fractional vegetation cover (FVC) by using remote sensing images has become feasible. Based on Landsat8-OLI images and field data obtained from an unmanned aerial vehicle, we established an empirical model (EM) and a pixel decomposition model (PDM) of FVC in the desert vegetation region, steppe vegetation region, meadow vegetation region and mixed vegetation region (the three vegetation region types) of the Qaidam Basin, and the inversion accuracies of the models were compared. The results show the following: (1) Vegetation classification inversion (VCI) provides a promising approach for FVC estimation. The accuracy of FVC by VCI was obviously better than that achieved using vegetation mixed inversion (VMI); (2) Differences were observed in the FVC estimation between VCI and VMI by the EM in areas with relatively high-density vegetation cover (FVC &gt; 60%). The FVC in some parts of steppe region in the basin was slightly overestimated by VMI of the EM; 3) VCI estimated by the PDM resulted in lower inversion values for extremely low-density vegetation cover (FVC &le; 10%) and higher inversion values for high-density vegetation cover (FVC &gt; 80%). The FVC inversion was underestimated by the PDM in steppe and meadow regions with FVC &gt; 15% in the basin. The application of VCI in different models can provide new ideas for the sustainable study of vegetation in arid regions.},

    ABSTRACT = {Remote sensing has been applied to map the extent and biophysical properties of mangroves. However, the impact of several critical factors, such as the fractional cover and leaf-to-total area ratio of mangroves, on their canopy reflectance have rarely been reported. In this study, a systematic global sensitivity analysis was performed for mangroves based on a one-dimensional canopy reflectance model. Different scenarios such as sparse or dense canopies were set up to evaluate the impact of various biophysical and environmental factors, together with their ranges and probability distributions, on simulated canopy reflectance spectra and selected Sentinel-2A vegetation indices of mangroves. A variance-based method and a density-based method were adopted to compare the computed sensitivity indices. Our results showed that the fractional cover and leaf-to-total area ratio of mangrove crowns were among the most influential factors for all examined scenarios. As for other factors, plant area index and water depth were influential for sparse canopies while leaf biochemical properties and inclination angles were more influential for dense canopies. Therefore, these influential factors may need attention when mapping the biophysical properties of mangroves such as leaf area index. Moreover, a tailored sensitivity analysis is recommended for a specific mapping application as the computed sensitivity indices may be different if a specific input configuration and sensitivity analysis method are adopted.},

    abstract = {Several studies use satellite-based normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) to monitor the impact of climate change on vegetation covers. Good understanding of the drivers of NDVI patterns is hindered by the difficulties in disentangling the effects of environmental factors from anthropogenic changes, by the limited number of environmental predictors studied, and by the diversity of responses according to periods and land covers. This study aims to improve our understanding of the different environmental drivers of NDVI spatial variations for different stand type characteristics of mountain and Mediterranean biomes. Using NDVI values extracted from MODIS Terra time series, we calculated Spring Greenness (SG) and annual Relative Greenness (RGRE) to depict spring and summer vegetation activity, respectively, in a contrasted area of 10,255 km2 located in the south of France. We modeled SG and RGRE at different scales, using 20 environmental predictors characterizing available energy, water supply, and nutrient supply calculated for different periods of the year. In spring, high minimum temperatures, good nitrogen availability, and acidic or neutral pH turned out to be determining for greenness, particularly for stand types located in altitude. In summer, an important soil water reserve and low temperatures promoted vegetation dynamics, particularly for stands located in areas with a Mediterranean climate. Our results show that NDVI dynamics was not only driven by climatic variability, and should not be studied using only mean temperature and rainfall. They highlight that different environmental factors act complementarily, and that soil parameters characterizing water stress and soil nutrition should be taken into account. While the factors limiting NDVI values varied according to the season and the position of the stands along the ecological gradients, we identified a global temperature and water-stress threshold when considering the whole vegetation.}

    ABSTRACT = {Agricultural subsidies in the context of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) represent over 40% of the EU’s yearly budget. To ensure that funds are properly spent, farmers are controlled by National Control and Paying Agencies (NCPA) using tools, such as computer-assisted photo interpretation (CAPI), which aims at identifying crops via remotely-sensed imagery. CAPI is time consuming and requires a large team of skilled photo interpreters. The objective of this study was to develop a reliable control system to partially replace CAPI for crop identification, with the overreaching goal of reducing control costs and completion time. Validated control data provided by the Portuguese Control and Paying Agency and an atmospherically-corrected Landsat ETM+ time series were used to perform parcel-based crop classification, leading to an accuracy of only 68% due to high similarity between crops’ spectral signatures. To address this problem, we propose an automatic control system (ACS) that couples crop classification to a reliability requirement. This allows the decision-maker to set a reliability level, which restricts automatic crop identification to parcels that are classified with high certainty. While higher reliability levels reduce the risk of misclassifications, lower levels increase the proportion of automatic control decisions (ACP). With a reliability level of 80%, more than half of the parcels in our study area are automatically identified with an overall accuracy of 84%. In particular, this allows automatically controlling over 85% of all parcels classified as maize, rice, wheat or vineyard.},

The shapes of leaves, petals and whole plants are of great significance to plant science, as they can help to distinguish between different species, to measure plant health, and even to model climate change. The growing interest in biodiversity and the increasing availability of digital images combine to make this topic timely. The global shortage of expert taxonomists further increases the demand for software tools that can recognize and characterize plants from images. A robust automated species identification system would allow people with only limited botanical training and expertise to carry out valuable field work. We review the main computational, morphometric and image processing methods that have been used in recent years to analyze images of plants, introducing readers to relevant botanical concepts along the way. We discuss the measurement of leaf outlines, flower shape, vein structures and leaf textures, and describe a wide range of analytical methods in use. We also discuss a number of systems that apply this research, including prototypes of hand-held digital field guides and various robotic systems used in agriculture. We conclude with a discussion of ongoing work and outstanding problems in the area."

    abstract = "Land cover mapping via image classification is sometimes realized through object-based image analysis. Objects are typically constructed by partitioning imagery into spatially contiguous groups of pixels through image segmentation and used as the basic spatial unit of analysis. As it is typically desirable to know the accuracy with which the objects have been delimited prior to undertaking the classification, numerous methods have been used for accuracy assessment. This paper reviews the state-of-the-art of image segmentation accuracy assessment in land cover mapping applications. First the literature published in three major remote sensing journals during 2014–2015 is reviewed to provide an overview of the field. This revealed that qualitative assessment based on visual interpretation was a widely-used method, but a range of quantitative approaches is available. In particular, the empirical discrepancy or supervised methods that use reference data for assessment are thoroughly reviewed as they were the most frequently used approach in the literature surveyed. Supervised methods are grouped into two main categories, geometric and non-geometric, and are translated here to a common notation which enables them to be coherently and unambiguously described. Some key considerations on method selection for land cover mapping applications are provided, and some research needs are discussed."

The analysis of characteristic features provides the requisite parameters that serve as constraints in the hypothesis model. The strength of the proposed method lies in the fact that the parameters in the algorithms are computed automatically and depend only on the context of the image under analysis. One of the key processes, the determination of region homogeneity, is treated as a sequence of decision problems in terms of predicates in the hypothesis model. Experimental results on natural scene pictures and medical images are included to demonstrate the robustness of the algorithm."

    abstract = {Robotic weed control through weed detection has become increasingly important due to mounting pressure on herbicides from resistance and the large impact of weeds on agricultural productivity. One of the major challenges is accurate classification of weed species for selective targeting in crop situations, whilst the existing studies are often conducted in well-controlled settings with consistent lighting, species and backgrounds. Therefore, in this study, we propose a novel graph-based deep learning architecture, namely Graph Weeds Net (GWN), which aims to recognize multiple types of weeds from conventional RGB images collected from complex rangelands. GWN collects regional patterns in line with set image scopes and formulates multi-scale graph representations for weed classification. Additionally, GWN provides suggestions for key regions, creating opportunities for further within-image actions for robotic in-field systems. The architecture was evaluated on a recently published benchmark dataset, achieving the state-of-the-art performance with a top-1 accuracy 98.1%.}

    abstract = {Weed control is a global issue, and has attracted great attention in recent years. Deploying autonomous robots for weed removal has great potential in terms of constructing environment-friendly agriculture, and saving manpower. In this paper, we propose a weed/crop segmentation network that provides better performance for precisely recognizing the weed with arbitrary shape in complex environment condition, and offers great support for autonomous robots to successfully reduce the density of weed. Our deep neural network (DNN)-based segmentation model obtains persistent improvements by integrating four additional components. i) Hybrid dilated convolution and DropBlock are introduced into the classification backbone network, where the hybrid dilated convolution enlarges the receptive field, while DropBlock regularizes the weight parameters to learn robust features by random drops contiguous regions. ii) A universal function approximation block is added to the front-end of the backbone network, which adaptively converts the existing RGB-NIR bands into optimized (RGB + NIR)-based indices to increase the classification performance. iii) The bridge attention block is exploited, in order to make the network “globally” refer to the correlated region, regardless of the distance for capturing the rich long-range contextual information. iv) The spatial pyramid refinement block is inserted to fuse multi-scale feature maps with different size of receptive fields to provide the precise localization of segmentation result, by maintaining the consistency of feature maps. We evaluate our network performance on two challenging Stuttgart and Bonn datasets. The state-of-the-art performance on the two datasets shows that each added component has notable potential to boost the segmentation accuracy.}

    ABSTRACT = {Weeds are one of the most important factors affecting agricultural production. The waste and pollution of farmland ecological environment caused by full-coverage chemical herbicide spraying are becoming increasingly evident. With the continuous improvement in the agricultural production level, accurately distinguishing crops from weeds and achieving precise spraying only for weeds are important. However, precise spraying depends on accurately identifying and locating weeds and crops. In recent years, some scholars have used various computer vision methods to achieve this purpose. This review elaborates the two aspects of using traditional image-processing methods and deep learning-based methods to solve weed detection problems. It provides an overview of various methods for weed detection in recent years, analyzes the advantages and disadvantages of existing methods, and introduces several related plant leaves, weed datasets, and weeding machinery. Lastly, the problems and difficulties of the existing weed detection methods are analyzed, and the development trend of future research is prospected.},

    ABSTRACT = {Crop productivity is readily reduced by competition from weeds. It is particularly important to control weeds early to prevent yield losses. Limited herbicide choices and increasing costs of weed management are threatening the profitability of crops. Smart agriculture can use intelligent technology to accurately measure the distribution of weeds in the field and perform weed control tasks in selected areas, which cannot only improve the effectiveness of pesticides, but also increase the economic benefits of agricultural products. The most important thing for an automatic system to remove weeds within crop rows is to utilize reliable sensing technology to achieve accurate differentiation of weeds and crops at specific locations in the field. In recent years, there have been many significant achievements involving the differentiation of crops and weeds. These studies are related to the development of rapid and non-destructive sensors, as well as the analysis methods for the data obtained. This paper presents a review of the use of three sensing methods including spectroscopy, color imaging, and hyperspectral imaging in the discrimination of crops and weeds. Several algorithms of machine learning have been employed for data analysis such as convolutional neural network (CNN), artificial neural network (ANN), and support vector machine (SVM). Successful applications include the weed detection in grain crops (such as maize, wheat, and soybean), vegetable crops (such as tomato, lettuce, and radish), and fiber crops (such as cotton) with unsupervised or supervised learning. This review gives a brief introduction into proposed sensing and machine learning methods, then provides an overview of instructive examples of these techniques for weed/crop discrimination. The discussion describes the recent progress made in the development of automated technology for accurate plant identification as well as the challenges and future prospects. It is believed that this review is of great significance to those who study automatic plant care in crops using intelligent technology.},

    abstract = {In a multidisciplinary scheme linking computer science with agricultural engineering, a novel approach based on orientation code matching (OCM) for robust, continuous, and site-specific observations of disease development in sugar beet plants is presented. Differing from conventional plant disease detection approaches, we introduce the robust template matching method of OCM in this paper to not only realize continuous and site-specific observations of disease progress, but also to demonstrate its excellent robustness for non-rigid plant object searching in scene illumination, translation, slight rotation, and occlusion changes. Furthermore, a single-feature two-dimensional xy-color histogram is proposed and input into support vector machine (SVM) classifier for pixel-wise disease classification and quantification. Experimental results with high precision and recall rates demonstrate the feasibility and potential of our proposed algorithm, which could be further implemented in real sugar beet fields with robust detection and precise quantization of foliar disease development, for better analysis of disease mechanism and optimal fungicide-spraying management.}

    ABSTRACT = {To construct a safe and sound autonomous driving system, object detection is essential, and research on fusion of sensors is being actively conducted to increase the detection rate of objects in a dynamic environment in which safety must be secured. Recently, considerable performance improvements in object detection have been achieved with the advent of the convolutional neural network (CNN) structure. In particular, the YOLO (You Only Look Once) architecture, which is suitable for real-time object detection by simultaneously predicting and classifying bounding boxes of objects, is receiving great attention. However, securing the robustness of object detection systems in various environments still remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose a weighted mean-based adaptive object detection strategy that enhances detection performance through convergence of individual object detection results based on an RGB camera and a LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) for autonomous driving. The proposed system utilizes the YOLO framework to perform object detection independently based on image data and point cloud data (PCD). Each detection result is united to reduce the number of objects not detected at the decision level by the weighted mean scheme. To evaluate the performance of the proposed object detection system, tests on vehicles and pedestrians were carried out using the KITTI Benchmark Suite. Test results demonstrated that the proposed strategy can achieve detection performance with a higher mean average precision (mAP) for targeted objects than an RGB camera and is also robust against external environmental changes.},

    ABSTRACT = {The aboveground fresh weight of weeds is an important indicator that reflects their biomass and physiological activity and directly affects the criteria for determining the amount of herbicides to apply. In precision agriculture, the development of models that can accurately locate weeds and predict their fresh weight can provide visual support for accurate, variable herbicide application in real time. In this work, we develop a two-stream dense feature fusion convolutional network model based on RGB-D data for the real-time prediction of the fresh weight of weeds. A data collection method is developed for the compilation and production of RGB-D data sets. The acquired images undergo data enhancement, and a depth transformation data enhancement method suitable for depth data is proposed. The main idea behind the approach in this study is to use the YOLO-V4 model to locate weeds and use the two-stream dense feature fusion network to predict their aboveground fresh weight. In the two-stream dense feature fusion network, DenseNet and NiN methods are used to construct a Dense-NiN-Block structure for deep feature extraction and fusion. The Dense-NiN-Block module was embedded in five convolutional neural networks for comparison, and the best results were achieved with DenseNet201. The test results show that the predictive ability of the convolutional network using RGB-D as the input is better than that of the network using RGB as the input without the Dense-NiN-Block module. The mAP of the proposed network is 75.34% (IoU value of 0.5), the IoU is 86.36%, the detection speed of the fastest model with a RTX2080Ti NVIDIA graphics card is 17.8 fps, and the average relative error is approximately 4%. The model proposed in this paper can provide visual technical support for precise, variable herbicide application. The model can also provide a reference method for the non-destructive prediction of crop fresh weight in the field and can contribute to crop breeding and genetic improvement.},

The approach consists of three stages. First, a feature that identifies hues with relatively high levels of green is used to extract the region of leaves and remove the background. Second, the Chan–Vese model and improved Sobel operator are implemented to extract the leaf contours and detect the edges, respectively. Third, a target leaf with a complex background and overlapping is extracted by combining the results obtained by the Chan–Vese model and Sobel operator. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, a segmentation experiment was performed on 30 images of cucumber leaf. The mean error rate of the proposed method is 0.0428, which is a decrease of 6.54% compared with the mean error rate of the level set method. Experimental results show that the proposed method can accurately extract the target leaf from cucumber leaf images with complex backgrounds and overlapping regions."

    ABSTRACT = {Image registration is a common operation in any type of image processing, specially in remote sensing images. Since the publication of the scale–invariant feature transform (SIFT) method, several algorithms based on feature detection have been proposed. In particular, KAZE builds the scale space using a nonlinear diffusion filter instead of Gaussian filters. Nonlinear diffusion filtering allows applying a controlled blur while the important structures of the image are preserved. Hyperspectral images contain a large amount of spatial and spectral information that can be used to perform a more accurate registration. This article presents HSI–KAZE, a method to register hyperspectral remote sensing images based on KAZE but considering the spectral information. The proposed method combines the information of a set of preselected bands, and it adapts the keypoint descriptor and the matching stage to take into account the spectral information. The method is adequate to register images in extreme situations in which the scale between them is very different. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm has been tested on real images taken on different dates, and presenting different types of changes. The experimental results show that the method is robust achieving image registrations with scales of up to     24 . 0 ×    .},

    abstract = {Reducing pesticide use is one of the high-priority targets in the quest for a sustainable agriculture. Until now, most studies dealing with pesticide use reduction have compared a limited number of experimental prototypes. Here we assessed the sustainability of 48 arable cropping systems from two major agricultural regions of France, including conventional, integrated and organic systems, with a wide range of pesticide use intensities and management (crop rotation, soil tillage, cultivars, fertilization, etc.). We assessed cropping system sustainability using a set of economic, environmental and social indicators. We failed to detect any positive correlation between pesticide use intensity and both productivity (when organic farms were excluded) and profitability. In addition, there was no relationship between pesticide use and workload. We found that crop rotation diversity was higher in cropping systems with low pesticide use, which would support the important role of crop rotation diversity in integrated and organic strategies. In comparison to conventional systems, integrated strategies showed a decrease in the use of both pesticides and nitrogen fertilizers, they consumed less energy and were frequently more energy efficient. Integrated systems therefore appeared as the best compromise in sustainability trade-offs. Our results could be used to re-design current cropping systems, by promoting diversified crop rotations and the combination of a wide range of available techniques contributing to pest management.},

However the current methods are limited when large and highly non-local deformations are present. In this paper, we introduce a new direct feature matching technique for non-parametric image registration where efficient nearest-neighbor searches find global correspondences between intensity, spatial and geometric information. We exploit graph spectral representations that are invariant to isometry under complex deformations. Our direct feature matching technique is used within the established Demons framework for diffeomorphic image registration. Our method, called Spectral Demons, can capture very large, complex and highly non-local deformations between images. We evaluate the improvements of our method on 2D and 3D images and demonstrate substantial improvement over the conventional Demons algorithm for large deformations.",

    ABSTRACT = {The Minimum Linear Arrangement problem (MinLA) consists in finding an ordering of the nodes of a weighted graph, such that the sum of the weighted edge lengths is minimized. We report on the usefulness of a new model within a branch-and-cut-and-price algorithm for solving MinLA problems to optimality. The key idea is to introduce binary variables d_{ijk}, that are equal to 1 if nodes i and j have distance k in the permutation. We present formulations for complete and for sparse graphs and explain the realization of a branch-and-cut-and-price algorithm. Furthermore, its different settings are discussed and evaluated. To the study of the theoretical aspects concerning the MinLA, we contribute a characterization of a relaxation of the corresponding polyeder. },

    abstract = {Crop agronomic parameters (leaf area index (LAI), nitrogen (N) uptake, total chlorophyll (Chl) content ) are very important for the prediction of crop growth. The objective of this experiment was to investigate whether the wheat LAI, N uptake, and total Chl content could be accurately predicted using spectral indices collected at different stages of wheat growth. Firstly, the product of the optimized soil-adjusted vegetation index and wheat biomass dry weight (OSAVI×BDW) were used to estimate LAI, N uptake, and total Chl content; secondly, BDW was replaced by spectral indices to establish new spectral indices (OSAVI×OSAVI, OSAVI×SIPI, OSAVI×CIred edge, OSAVI×CIgreen mode and OSAVI×EVI2); finally, we used the new spectral indices for estimating LAI, N uptake, and total Chl content. The results showed that the new spectral indices could be used to accurately estimate LAI, N uptake, and total Chl content. The highest R2 and the lowest RMSEs were 0.711 and 0.78 (OSAVI×EVI2), 0.785 and 3.98 g/m2 (OSAVI×CIred edge) and 0.846 and 0.65 g/m2 (OSAVI×CIred edge) for LAI, nitrogen uptake and total Chl content, respectively. The new spectral indices performed better than the OSAVI alone, and the problems of a lack of sensitivity at earlier growth stages and saturation at later growth stages, which are typically associated with the OSAVI, were improved. The overall results indicated that this new spectral indices provided the best approximation for the estimation of agronomic indices for all growth stages of wheat.},

This review focuses on technological aspects of integrating unmanned aerial vehicles with imaging systems to enhance field phenotyping capabilities. The state-of-the-art of unmanned aerial vehicle technology for various applications including crop emergence, vigor, and characterization of yield potential of row and field crops has been reviewed. The potential of using aerial imaging to evaluate resistance/susceptibility to biotic and abiotic stress for crop breeding and precision production management has been discussed along with future perspectives and developments."

    ABSTRACT = {This study presents a complex empirical image-based radiometric calibration method for a Tetracam &mu;MCA multispectral frame camera. The workflow is based on a laboratory investigation of the camera&rsquo;s radiometric properties combined with vicarious atmospheric correction using an empirical line. The effect of the correction is demonstrated on out-of-laboratory field campaign data. The dark signal noise behaviour was investigated based on the exposure time and ambient temperature. The vignette effect coupled with nonuniform quantum efficiency was studied with respect to changing exposure times and illuminations to simulate field campaign conditions. The efficiency of the proposed correction workflow was validated by comparing the reflectance values that were extracted from a fully corrected image and the raw data of the reference spectroscopy measurement using three control targets. The Normalized Root Mean Square Errors (NRMSE) of all separate bands ranged from 0.24 to 2.10%, resulting in a significant improvement of the NRMSE compared to the raw data. The results of a field experiment demonstrated that the proposed correction workflow significantly improves the quality of multispectral imagery. The workflow was designed to be applicable to the out-of-laboratory conditions of UAV imaging campaigns in variable natural conditions and other types of multiarray imaging systems.},

    abstract = {Shape skeletons are commonly used in generic shape recognition as they capture part hierarchy, providing a structural representation of shapes. However, their potential for shape classification has not been investigated much. In this study, we present a similarity-based approach for classifying 2D shapes based on their Aslan skeletons ([Aslan and Tari, 2005], [Aslan et al., 2008]). The coarse structure of this skeleton representation allows us to represent each shape category in the form of a reduced set of prototypical trees, offering an alternative solution to the problem of selecting the best representative examples. The ensemble of these category prototypes is then used to form a similarity-based representation space in which the similarities between a given shape and the prototypes are computed using a tree edit distance algorithm, and support vector machine (SVM) classifiers are used to predict the category membership of the shape based on computed similarities.}

    abstract = {Weeds are among the major factors that could harm crop yield. With the advances in electronic and information technologies, machine vision combined with image processing techniques has become a promising tool for precise real-time weed and crop detection in the field, providing valuable sensing information for site-specific weed management. This review summarized the advances of weed detection using ground-based machine vision and image processing techniques. Concretely, the four procedures, i.e., pre-processing, segmentation, feature extraction and classification, for weed detection were presented in detail. To separate vegetation from background, different color indices and classification approaches like color index-based, threshold-based and learning-based ones, were developed. The difficulty of weed detection lies in discriminating between crops and weeds that often have similar properties. Generally, four categories of features, i.e., biological morphology, spectral features, visual textures and spatial contexts, were used for the task, which were discussed in this review. Application of conventional machine learning-based and recently developed deep learning-based approaches for weed detection were also presented. Finally, challenges and solutions provided by researchers for weed detection in the field, including occlusion and overlap of leaves, varying lighting conditions and different growth stages, were discussed.}
